#+TITLE: GFS and MapReduce (HDFS, Hadoop)
** GFS
*** Big Data [input, problem]
**** Web scale data
***** How much data does Google collect?  Or Facebook?
      In 2009, Google collects 24PB of data per day.
*** Shapes
**** You need a distributed system, and all the problems that come with it
***** Fault tolerance !!!  Be okay with nodes dying
**** Locality is efficiency.
**** Write throughput and block reads >> any other file operation
     Write once, read once.  Boils down to append (e.g. logfiles) and chunked reads.  We don't need to edit files, for example, at least not the original.
*** Architecture
